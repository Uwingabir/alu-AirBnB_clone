This current project is a command-line interface tool designed to contribute to the management of vacation rentals, an example of which is the site Airbnb. It enables users to manage listings, bookings, and guests effectively by running create, read, update, and delete operations on Listings, Hosts, Guests, and Reservations within a simplified schema of the Vacation Rental Management System.
